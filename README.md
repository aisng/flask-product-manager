# Product manager

Two basic Flask apps where the `client` app can see the data from and perform CRUD operations to the `server` api.

## Running the application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the server: `python server/app.py` (runs on default Flask port 5000)
4. Run the client: `python client/app.py` (runs on port 8000)
5. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000
